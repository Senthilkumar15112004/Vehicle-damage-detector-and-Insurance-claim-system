## 🌟 Overview  
Insurance claim processing is slow, manual, and often inconsistent. This project solves the problem with an **AI-powered system** that:  
✔ Detects car damage from uploaded images  
✔ Identifies damage regions (segmentation)  
✔ Estimates repair cost using a smart cost engine  
✔ Auto-generates professional claim reports  
✔ Provides a streamlined Admin approval workflow  

Built for real-world insurance scenarios with deep business logic and automation.

## 🚀 Key Features  

### 👤 User Panel  
- **⚡ Instant AI Damage Analysis**  
  Upload any damaged vehicle image → system detects dents, scratches, glass breaks, and severity.  
- **💰 Smart Cost Engine**  
  Auto-calculates labor + parts cost based on severity and car age.  
- **🔥 Heatmap Visualization**  
  Highlights damaged regions using segmentation masks.  
- **📄 PDF Estimation Reports**  
  Professional invoice-style PDF with GST, parts, labor, and total cost.  
- **📝 Claim History Tracking**  
  View claim status: *Submitted → Under Review → Approved/Rejected*.  
- **🔐 Secure Login**  
  JWT authentication + Google OAuth2 login support.

### 👮 Admin Dashboard  
- **📊 Real-time Analytics:** Total claims, pending, completed, and user activity.  
- **🚦 Traffic Light Indicators:**  
  Green = Approved, Yellow = Pending Review, Red = Rejected.  
- **🔧 Claim Review Actions:**  
  Approve, Reject, Add comments.  
- **📁 User Management:**  
  Manage registered policyholders.

## 🧠 Business Logic & Rules  

### 1. 📉 Multiple Claim Deduction  
- **1st Claim:** 100% coverage  
- **2nd Claim (within 12 months):** 50% deduction  
- **3rd Claim+:** Flagged as *High Risk*, manual review required  

### 2. 🛡 Zero Depreciation Policy  
- When ON → 100% reimbursement for parts  
- When OFF → 20–40% depreciation based on vehicle age

### 3. 🛑 Total Loss Detection  
Claim flagged as **Total Loss** if:  
```
Repair Cost > 75% of Vehicle IDV
```

### 4. 🛠 Repair vs Replace Algorithm  
- Glass/Lights → Always replaced  
- Damage confidence > 85% → Replace  
- Moderate damage → Repair + repaint (cost-optimized)
